## Run the project
python menu.py 

Follow the promp to select which agent should be loaded ( Tabular Q learning or Deep Q Learning).
The agent will then start training.
In order to reduce the training time, the Tabular Q learning agent is implemented without obstacles and still requires about 600 games played to show results.
The Deep Q Learning Agent will show good results after 100 games played.
